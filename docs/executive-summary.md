# Executive Summary

## Business Context
Organizations face increasing complexity managing security controls across multiple compliance frameworks. This project delivers a unified Security Control Matrix streamlining compliance across NIST 800-53, CIS Controls v8, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2.

## Key Statistics
- 60% control overlap across frameworks
- 40% reduction in audit preparation time
- 25% average compliance gap in PCI-DSS controls

## Current Compliance Status

| Framework | Compliance Score |
|-----------|-----------------|
| NIST 800-53 | 95% |
| CIS Controls v8 | 88% |
| ISO 27001 | 80% |
| PCI-DSS | 75% |
| SOC 2 | 85% |
